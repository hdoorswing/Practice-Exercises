I sometimes struggle with knowing when to indent; however, as a math major, tree diagrams are something that's very familiar to me. I realized that if I want a large or complicated nested structure it might be best to sketch it out as a tree diagram or think of it as an outline in a Word Doc to keep everything organized.
