I changed this from a movie ranking project to an anime ranking project as I don't really watch movies anymore.

In this project, I learned about the use of Lorem Ipsum. It was pretty fun to find different generators. 
In this project I used a Japanese one so it fit the theme a little more.

It was defintely nostalgic to see a website that was only in HTML which made it fun.
