I learned that you can change multiple different features of the boxes that surround divs including the margin, padding, border thickness, etc.
I also learned that you can change the border so the thickness is different on each side. I  have yet to see where it works out to be aesthetically pleasing to do so but hey, we can at least do it just because we want to ðŸ¤—
